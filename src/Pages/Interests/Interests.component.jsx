        Web developing! Apart from that, I enjoy the great outdoors whether it
        be mountain biking, rock climbing, skiing, backpacking, hiking, or just
        taking a step back to appreciate it all.

        Not only do I love building with code, I also like building with my
        hands. My wife and I converted a cargo van into a campervan that we have
        been traveling in for over a year. The environment is something I am
        expecially passionate about, Earth is the only home we have, lets find
        ways to better her.
